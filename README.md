This plugin provides a search interface to the objects on the vector charts in OpenCPN. Note that it indexes the objects on the charts which were loaded at least once with the plugin enabled.

## Building

This assumes you have already seen the building instructions at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/compiling_source_linux or http://opencpn.org/ocpn/compiling_source_windows and can build OpenCPN from source.

### Linux:

```
git clone https://github.com/nohal/objsearch_pi.git
cd objsearch_pi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Windows:

You must have opencpn.lib created while OpenCPN application is built in the build folder. If you don't want to make one yourself, there are several prebuilt versions at https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpnplugins/files/opencpn_lib/ - you need one corresponding to version newer than 3.3.2028

```
git clone https://github.com/nohal/objsearch_pi.git
cd objsearch_pi
mkdir build
```

Copy opencpn.lib into the newly created build folder

```
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config release
```

## CSV Data Import

The format of the CSV is simple:
```Lat, Lon, Object name, Feature name,"Source" name[[,Scale],PPM Scale]```
Strings containing commas of course have to be quoted, the scale fields are optional
